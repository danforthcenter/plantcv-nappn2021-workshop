# NAPPN 2021 Conference PlantCV virtual workshop materials

This repository contains materials used in the PlantCV workshop (February 16, 2021 from 8:30am to 11:00am CST) in the 2021 NAPPN Annual Conference (https://www.nappn2021.org/).

## Image analysis in Python with PlantCV

This workshop aims to provide a virtual, hands-on, and interactive introduction to image analysis with Python and PlantCV (https://plantcv.danforthcenter.org/). Participants will utilize interactive coding environments in the cloud (Jupyter notebooks) to gain hands-on experience with importing and working with image data in Python using PlantCV and other open-source tools. The learning goals of the workshop are: 1) participants will gain an understanding of image data structure and the primary tools available in Python to work with image data; 2) participants will learn how to use PlantCV to build image analysis workflows; 3) participants will learn how to process image data in parallel using PlantCV workflows; and 4) participants will gain a brief introduction to visualizing phenotypic measurements extracted from a PlantCV workflow analysis.

### Agenda
